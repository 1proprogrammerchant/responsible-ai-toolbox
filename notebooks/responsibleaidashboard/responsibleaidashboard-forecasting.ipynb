The supported imputing methods for target column are constant and ffill (forward fill). The supported imputing methods for feature columns are mean, median, most frequent, constant and ffill (forward fill). This customization can be used for the scenario that our customers know which imputation methods fit best to the input data.

To achieve this behavior, these columns need to be configured as constant imputation with `fill_value` 0.\n",

        "The [AutoMLConfig](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-train-automl-client/azureml.train.automl.automlconfig.automlconfig?view=azure-ml-py) object defines the settings and data for an AutoML training job. Here, we set necessary inputs like the task type, the number of AutoML iterations to try, the training data, and cross-validation parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For forecasting tasks, there are some additional parameters that can be set in the `ForecastingParameters` class: the name of the column holding the date/time, the timeseries id column names, and the maximum forecast horizon. A time column is required for forecasting, while the time_series_id is optional. If time_series_id columns are not given, AutoML assumes that the whole dataset is a single time-series. We also pass a list of columns to drop prior to modeling. The _logQuantity_ column is completely correlated with the target quantity, so it must be removed to prevent a target leak.\n",
        "\n",
        "The forecast horizon is given in units of the time-series frequency; for instance, the OJ series frequency is weekly, so a horizon of 20 means that a trained model will estimate sales up to 20 weeks beyond the latest date in the training data for each series. In this example, we set the forecast horizon to the number of samples per series in the test set (n_test_periods). Generally, the value of this parameter will be dictated by business needs. For example, a demand planning application that estimates the next month of sales should set the horizon according to suitable planning time-scales. Please see the [energy_demand notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/forecasting-energy-demand) for more discussion of forecast horizon.\n",
        "\n",
        "We note here that AutoML can sweep over two types of time-series models:\n",
        "* Models that are trained for each series such as ARIMA and Facebook's Prophet.\n",
        "* Models trained across multiple time-series using a regression approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first case, AutoML loops over all time-series in your dataset and trains one model (e.g. AutoArima or Prophet, as the case may be) for each series. This can result in long runtimes to train these models if there are a lot of series in the data. One way to mitigate this problem is to fit models for different series in parallel if you have multiple compute cores available. To enable this behavior, set the `max_cores_per_iteration` parameter in your AutoMLConfig as shown in the example in the next cell. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, a note about the cross-validation (CV) procedure for time-series data. AutoML uses out-of-sample error estimates to select a best pipeline/model, so it is important that the CV fold splitting is done correctly. Time-series can violate the basic statistical assumptions of the canonical K-Fold CV strategy, so AutoML implements a [rolling origin validation](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/) procedure to create CV folds for time-series data. To use this procedure, you could specify the desired number of CV folds and the number of periods between two consecutive folds in the AutoMLConfig object, or AutoMl could set them automatically if you don't specify them. It is also possible to bypass CV and use your own validation set by setting the *validation_data* parameter of AutoMLConfig.\n",
